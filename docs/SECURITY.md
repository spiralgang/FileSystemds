# MobileOps Platform Security Framework

## Overview

The MobileOps platform implements a comprehensive security framework designed to protect mobile applications, infrastructure, and data throughout the entire development and deployment lifecycle.

## Security Architecture

### Zero Trust Security Model

The platform operates on a zero trust security model where:
- No implicit trust is granted to any component
- Every request is authenticated and authorized
- All communications are encrypted
- Continuous verification and monitoring

### Defense in Depth

Multiple layers of security controls:
1. **Network Security**: Firewall, intrusion detection, network segmentation
2. **Application Security**: Code analysis, vulnerability scanning, secure coding practices
3. **Data Security**: Encryption, access controls, data loss prevention
4. **Infrastructure Security**: Hardened systems, patch management, configuration management
5. **Identity Security**: Multi-factor authentication, identity governance, privileged access management

## Security Components

### 1. Identity and Access Management (IAM)

#### Authentication
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Single sign-on (SSO) integration
- Certificate-based authentication
- Biometric authentication for mobile devices

#### Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- Just-in-time (JIT) access
- Principle of least privilege

```bash
# Configure authentication
./toolbox_integrity_check.sh check
./ai_core_manager.sh config --auth-required true

# Set up RBAC
./plugin_manager.sh install rbac-plugin
```

### 2. Data Protection

#### Encryption
- **Data at Rest**: AES-256 encryption for stored data
- **Data in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Database Encryption**: Transparent data encryption
- **Application-Level Encryption**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive data

#### Key Management
- Centralized key management system
- Hardware security modules (HSM) support
- Key rotation and lifecycle management
- Secure key distribution

```bash
# Enable encryption
./asset_manager.sh config --encrypt-assets true
./ai_core_manager.sh config --encrypt-models true

# Configure key management
./toolbox_integrity_check.sh baseline
```

### 3. Network Security

#### Network Segmentation
- Microsegmentation for container networks
- VLAN isolation for different environments
- Software-defined perimeter (SDP)
- Network access control (NAC)

#### Traffic Protection
- Web application firewall (WAF)
- Distributed denial of service (DDoS) protection
- Intrusion detection and prevention (IDS/IPS)
- Network traffic analysis

```bash
# Configure network security
