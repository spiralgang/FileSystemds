# Contributing

We welcome contributions from everyone. Please follow the following guidelines when posting a GitHub Pull Request or filing a GitHub Issue on the FileSystemds project:

## Filing Issues

* We use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/spiralgang/FileSystemds/issues) **exclusively** for tracking **bugs** and **feature** **requests** (RFEs) of FileSystemds.
  If you are looking for help, please check the project documentation or file an issue for general questions.
* When filing a feature request issue (RFE), please always check first if the newest version of FileSystemds already implements the feature,
  and whether there's already an issue filed for your feature by someone else.
* When filing an issue, specify the **FileSystemds** **version** you are experiencing the issue with. Also, indicate which **platform** (Android, desktop, etc.) you are using.
* Please include an explanation how to reproduce the issue you are pointing out.

Following these guidelines makes it easier for us to process your issue, and ensures we won't close your issue right-away for being misfiled.

## Submitting Pull Requests

* Please make sure to run any existing tests and linting before submitting your PR.
* Follow the existing code style and conventions in the project.
* Include a clear description of what your changes do and why they're needed.
* Reference any relevant issues in your PR description.

## Development Guidelines

This project follows a modular, agent-driven, mobile/cloud-first architecture. When contributing:

* Prefer modular, composable components over monolithic solutions
* Design for mobile/edge environments
* Consider agent and automation-friendly interfaces
* Include appropriate tests and documentation
* Follow the project's security and quality standards
